                This is an app that I built using Swift, during my Built By Girls Focus Course at Chapin. This is an app that allows pets users to manage their pets. Based on the pet chosen by the user the app will create a list of certain reminders of things they have to do for that pet with the time they should do it as well. There is also a home page and profile page.(Currently it has no information on it, but eventually it will have photos from other users)</p>
